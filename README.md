# Air-Quality-Index-Analysis
For each pollutant, an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to a concentration in ambient air equal to the level of the national short-term ambient air quality standard for the protection of public health. AQI values ​​equal to or less than 100 are generally considered satisfactory.  When AQI values ​​are above 100, the air quality is unhealthy: first for certain groups of sensitive people, then for everyone as AQI values ​​increase.  The AQI is divided into six categories. Each category corresponds to a different level of health problem. Each category also has a specific colour. Colour allows people to quickly determine if the air quality is reaching unhealthy levels in their communities.Now let’s get started with Data Science project on Air Quality Index analysis with Python. I will recommend you to use Kaggle notebook for this task.   The reason why I am recommending you to use a Kaggle notebook you will understand at the end of this article, as we are going to use some APIs provided by Kaggle so I hope you will use a Kaggle notebook for the task of Air Quality Index analysis with Python.
